# Power BI Projects
## By AZOUGA Mourad

Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository! As a data analytics student at FSTT, I frequently encounter the demand for Power BI skills in job offers. To enhance my proficiency and practical experience, I created this repository to showcase the Power BI projects I am working on. This space will serve as a collection of my work, documenting my progress and the insights gained from each project.
